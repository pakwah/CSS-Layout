    <h1>Tim Cook is gay</h1>
    <div>
    <p class="first">Simon Hobbs is likely wishing he could press rewind. The CNBC co-anchor spoke too soon during a live segment of "Squawk on the Street".</p>
    <p>Friday when he accidentally outed Apple CEO Tim Cook.New York Times columnist and CNBC contributor James B. Stewart spoke about his recent column dealing with the "tortured life" former BP chief John Browne led as a closeted gay CEO."I just found it very, very fascinating,"</p>
    <p>Stewart said about Browne being the first CEO of a Fortune 500 or FTSE 100 company to publicly acknowledge that he is gay after being outed by a tabloid.Shortly after, Browne resigned from BP in 2007.</p>
<p class ="clear">Upon speaking to the closeted gay CEOs Stewart was aware of, he realized how none were willing to be identified although their initial interaction was pleasant.</p>
<p>"I got an extremely cool reception," he recalled, adding that "not one would allow to be named at all.""I think Tim Cook is open about the fact he's gay at the head of Apple," Hobbs said. "Isn't he?"An awkward silence followed as Hobbs quickly realized his snafu."Hmm, no," Stewart said shaking his head.</p>
